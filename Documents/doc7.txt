@105876 I ordered a new phone directly from your website over two weeks ago, and it was supposed to arrive within 5 business days. The tracking link provided hasn’t been updated since the day it shipped, and now I’m stuck with no updates and no idea when it will arrive. I’ve tried contacting customer service multiple times, but I keep getting told that they’re “looking into it.” I need this phone urgently, and the delay is causing serious inconvenience. Can you please investigate what’s happening with my order and provide a more concrete answer on when I can expect to receive it?
