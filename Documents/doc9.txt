@105878 I’ve been having trouble with my smart TV ever since the most recent update. It randomly disconnects from Wi-Fi in the middle of streaming, and I have to manually reconnect it every time, which ruins the viewing experience. I’ve tried resetting the network settings, rebooting the TV, and even factory resetting it, but the issue persists. My other devices don’t have this problem, so I’m confident it’s not an issue with my router. Is this something other users have reported since the update, and is there a fix on the way? It’s becoming really frustrating to use the TV for streaming services.
