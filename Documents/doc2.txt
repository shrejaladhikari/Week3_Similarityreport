@105871 I’m having a major issue with my laptop. It keeps randomly restarting without warning, and it’s affecting my ability to work. I’ve checked for updates, scanned for malware, and even tried a factory reset, but the problem persists. This only started happening after the most recent Windows update, and I’m not sure if that’s what’s causing the issue. I’ve lost important work because of this, and I need a solution quickly. Can you help me figure out what’s going on and how to stop these random shutdowns?
