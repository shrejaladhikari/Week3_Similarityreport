@105875 I’ve been having an issue with my smart home system where the devices keep disconnecting from the network at random times throughout the day. I’ve tried restarting the router, reconnecting each device individually, and even resetting the hub, but nothing seems to permanently fix the issue. The devices show as offline in the app, and I’m unable to control them remotely, which is a problem since I use the system to manage my home security. This has been going on for about a month now, and it’s incredibly frustrating. Could you advise on what might be causing this or provide any troubleshooting steps I haven’t tried yet?
