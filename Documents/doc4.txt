@105873 I’m having a serious issue with my Wi-Fi connection at home. It keeps dropping multiple times throughout the day, and I have to manually reconnect my devices each time. I’ve already rebooted the router, checked for firmware updates, and even contacted my internet provider, but they say everything looks fine on their end. I’m not sure what else to try, but this is making it impossible to work from home or even stream videos without constant interruptions. Can someone help troubleshoot this and let me know what might be causing the frequent disconnects?
