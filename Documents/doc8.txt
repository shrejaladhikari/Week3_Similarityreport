@105877 After installing the latest software update on my MacBook, I’ve been having major performance issues. The laptop runs much slower than before, and I’ve noticed frequent overheating even when I’m only running basic programs like the browser and a word processor. I’ve checked Activity Monitor, but there doesn’t seem to be anything unusual eating up resources. I’ve also tried resetting the SMC and PRAM, but the performance hasn’t improved. I rely on this laptop for my freelance work, and I can’t afford for it to be slow like this. Any advice on how to fix this or whether the update caused these issues?
