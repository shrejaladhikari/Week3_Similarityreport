@105872 I ordered a new gaming console about a month ago, and it still hasn’t arrived. The tracking information shows that it’s been in transit for weeks, but there’s no further update. I’ve tried contacting the shipping company, but they directed me back to the seller. I’m getting really frustrated because this was supposed to be a gift, and now it’s way past the delivery date. Can someone please look into this and let me know what’s going on with my order? I’d appreciate an update or at least a refund if the package is lost.
