@105870 Ever since I updated my phone to the latest version of Android, my battery life has been terrible. It used to last almost a full day, but now it barely gets through a few hours, even when I’m only using basic apps like messaging and email. I’ve already tried resetting my phone, adjusting the battery optimization settings, and turning off background apps, but nothing has improved the battery life. This is really frustrating, especially because I rely on my phone for work. Could you provide any suggestions or let me know if this is a common issue with the new update?
