@105879 I’ve been facing a recurring issue with my fitness tracker where it’s not accurately tracking my steps or heart rate. I’ve tried resetting the device and making sure it’s worn correctly on my wrist, but the readings are still way off compared to what they used to be. I rely on the tracker for my workouts, and this inaccuracy is making it difficult to track my progress. I’ve also noticed that the sync between the tracker and the app has been slow or failing entirely. Could you help me figure out what’s going wrong and whether there’s a fix or if I should consider replacing the device?
